# Curriculum-Planner-with-Student-Performance-Data
Project Overview
This project integrates student performance data with the Curriculum Planner Ontology. By using RDF and Turtle syntax, we can represent academic data in a structured, semantic format. This approach allows for advanced querying and reasoning over the data, providing a robust foundation for educational analytics and planning.

Project Goals
Data Integration: Combine student performance data with the Curriculum Planner Ontology to create a comprehensive educational dataset.
Semantic Representation: Use RDF and Turtle syntax to model the data, ensuring it is machine-readable and semantically rich.
Advanced Querying: Enable complex queries and reasoning over the data using GraphDB or other RDF triple stores.
Ontology Utilization: Leverage the Curriculum Planner Ontology to structure and relate educational data entities like students, courses, and grades.
What You Will Learn
Ontology Modeling: Understand how to use ontologies to represent domain-specific data.
RDF and Turtle Syntax: Gain proficiency in RDF (Resource Description Framework) and Turtle (Terse RDF Triple Language) for data serialization.
GraphDB Usage: Learn to import, store, and query RDF data using GraphDB or other RDF triple stores.
Data Semantics: Appreciate the value of semantic data representation for enhanced data interoperability and querying capabilities.
Achievements
By the end of this project, you will have:

Integrated Dataset: A unified dataset combining student performance metrics with an academic ontology.
Structured Data: Data represented in a structured, semantic format that can be easily queried and analyzed.
Enhanced Query Capabilities: The ability to perform complex queries on the educational data using SPARQL.
Ontology Application: Practical experience in applying an ontology to real-world data.
